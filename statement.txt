Problem Statement:
Manual calculation of student grades takes time and can also cause mistakes. Relative grading requires calculating mean and standard deviation for each subject. This project automates this process.

Scope:
The program takes an Excel file which has marks of students. It calculates grades for each subject. It calculates grades for each subject using relative grading rules and creates a new excel file with every subject grade columns.

Target Users:
Teachers, Students and institutions who want quick grade calculation.

Introduction:
Grade calculation for students become difficult when the number of 
students increases.
This project helps to automatically calculate grade of students using 
Python. Instead of manual grading, the system uses mean and standard 
deviation to assign relative grades.
The project works completely on Google Colab and produces an Excel 
file with grade columns as output.

Objective:
• To automate grade calculation using relative grading
• To apply grade rules for 5 subjects
• To generate a final Excel file with grade columns
• To simplify teachers workload

Functional Requirements:
a. Upload Excel file
b. Read marks for S1–S5
c. Calculate mean and SD
d. Apply grade logic
e. Export Excel with Grade_S1 … Grade_S5

Non-Functional Requirements:
a. Accuracy: Correct mean, SD and grade
b. Usability: Easy upload and download
c. Efficiency: Processes all students quickly
d. Reliability: Same output every time

Implementation Details:
The project uses Google Colab for execution. The pandas is used to read the 
Excel File. 
The mean and standard deviations for each subject are calculated. 
The get_grade() function assigns grades based on conditions.
The final DataFrame is exported to a new Excel file.

Results:
The system produces a new Excel file named VITB_GradeSystem.xlsx.
It contains subjects S1–S5, total, average, and new grade columns.

Testing:
Tested with:
• High marks
• Low marks (<40)
• Average marks
• Random values
The function correctly produced S, A, B, C, D, E, and F.

Challenges:
Understanding mean–SD logic
Adding fail condition
Applying lambda function

Learnings:
Pandas DataFrame handling
Using Numpy for mean/SD
Using Google Colab for automation
Writing grade logic function

Future Enhancements:
Add visualization
Add Tkinter UI (optional)
Add student name mapping
Store data in database

Conclusion:
The project successfully automates relative grading using Python.
It reduces manual work and produces error-free results.
Google Colab made the implementation simple and accessible.
