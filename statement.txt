Target Users:
Teachers, Students and institutions who want quick grade calculation.

Main Features:
• Upload Excel file in Google Colab 
• Calculates mean and standard deviation for each subject 
• Applies relative grading and F if marks<40
• Downloads a new Excel file with Grade_S1 to Grade_S5 columns
